## Practice pipetting and serial dilutions

Serial dilution is a method used to manipulate the amount of something in a sample. In the future, you will be working with phage stocks of unknown concentrations. You will use serial dilutions to purify, amplify, and titer your phage. This protocol uses 10-fold serial dilutions, meaning that the concentration of dye in each tube is 10 times less than the previous tube, allowing for easy mathematical calculations.

### Materials
{: .no_toc }
- TO_DO (buffer)
- Dye solution requiring dilution
- Microcentrifuge tubes 

## Procedure:
{: .no_toc }
1. Prepare your bench for aseptic work and assemble your supplies.
1. Set up 10-fold serial dilutions.
1. Arrange the proper number of microcentrifuge tubes in a rack and label them 10-1, 10-2, 10-3,….10-8.
1. Important: See “Helpful Tips” to determine how many dilutions to make.
1. Add 90 μl of _____ buffer to each of the tubes.
1. Perform 10-fold serial dilutions (Figure 6.2-1).
1. Add 10 μl of your undiluted dye sample to the “10-1” tube and vortex well.
1. The solution in this “10-1” tube contains 1/10th the concentration of dye as your undiluted sample. It is also referred to as a 1:10 dilution.
1. Make sure to use a clean pipette tip for each transfer and pipette carefully, vortexing your sample well before making each dilution. Otherwise, you will not make accurate 10-fold dilutions.
1. Transfer 10 μl of the “10 -1” sample to the “10-2” tube and vortex well.
1. This solution contains 1/100th as much dye as your undiluted sample. It can also be referred to as your 1:100 dilution.
1. Continue each successive dilution until you get to your last tube.
1. Read-out step (e.g., plate reader, fluorescence, OD).
1. A brief video demonstrating this protocol is available here.
