## Practice pipetting and serial dilutions

Serial dilution is a method used to manipulate the amount of something in a sample. In the future, you will be working with phage stocks of unknown concentrations. You will use serial dilutions to purify, amplify, and titer your phage. This protocol uses 10-fold serial dilutions, meaning that the concentration of dye in each tube is 10 times less than the previous tube, allowing for easy mathematical calculations.

### Materials
{: .no_toc }
- Buffer
- Blue dye requiring dilution
- Microcentrifuge tubes 

## Procedure:
{: .no_toc }
1. Prepare your bench for aseptic work and assemble your supplies.
1. üñäÔ∏èüß™ Arrange the 7 microcentrifuge tubes in a rack and label them 10<sup>-1</sup>, 10<sup>-2</sup>, 10<sup>-3</sup>,‚Ä¶.10<sup>-7</sup>.
1. ‚ûï Add 90 Œºl of buffer to each of the tubes.
>Perform 10-fold serial dilutions like in the picture below.
1. ‚ûï Add 10 Œºl of your undiluted dye sample to the ‚Äú10-1‚Äù tube and vortex well.
1. The solution in this ‚Äú10-1‚Äù tube contains 1/10th the concentration of dye as your undiluted sample. It is also referred to as a 1:10 dilution.
>Make sure to use a clean pipette tip for each transfer and pipette carefully, vortexing your sample well before making each dilution. Otherwise, you will not make accurate 10-fold dilutions.
1. Transfer 10 Œºl of the ‚Äú10 -1‚Äù sample to the ‚Äú10-2‚Äù tube and vortex well.
1. This solution contains 1/100th as much dye as your undiluted sample. It can also be referred to as your 1:100 dilution.
1. Continue each successive dilution until you get to your last tube. This tube is a 1:10 million dilution of your original dye!
