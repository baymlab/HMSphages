Much like a wave passes through water or a flame burns a candle wick, life is better understood as a phenomenon passing through matter than as a collection of animated objects. The dynamic processes that allow life, growth, and procreation are generally deadly if they are misregulated (i.e., when they occur in the wrong time or place). My goal is to understand how the most basic and fundamental processes of life - cell growth, cell division, cell separation, and related processes - spontaneously organize to allow life to flourish. Also, I began my scientific career in a community college setting, and helping expose community college students to research experience is an important part of my personal mission as an academic scientist.
