As a former bench scientist and current lab manager, it's my goal to create and maintain an environment that makes your experience in the lab as seamless and productive as possible.  I find fulfillment in ensuring that we have everything we need to succeed and do great science at the bench and beyond.  I am excited to see the work you'll be doing during this research program.
