I am fascinated by the diversity and complexity of the microbial world. I find the ability of these “simple” microorganisms to reliably grow and even thrive in a variety of environments both remarkable and inspiring. My current research is focused on understanding how bacteria coordinate the expansion of their multi-layered cell envelope, allowing for consistent growth and division. When I’m not working at the bench, you might find me exploring the outdoors, solving a jigsaw puzzle, or playing with clay.
