## Welcome to the HMS Phages 2022 program website!

HMS Phages is an 8-week summer program funded by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute offering research internships to undergraduate students from Roxbury Community College. This summer we will be isolating and sequencing novel bacteriophages relevant to research efforts in the Bernhardt and Baym laboratories at Harvard Medical School. This website serves as a centralized hub for our protocols and resources. Find out more about the HMS Phages 2022 team on the About the Program page.
