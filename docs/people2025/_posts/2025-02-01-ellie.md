I am a graduate student in the Baym lab, and I am fascinated by the diversity  of microbes in the environment. For my phd project, I have developed a novel method to isolate environmental phages that will hopefully be useful for ecological and clinical research in the future. I love exploring new samples, and I can't wait to see what we find this summer!
