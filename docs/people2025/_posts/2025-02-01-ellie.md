I recently completed my PhD in the Baym lab and am fascinated by the diversity of microbes in the environment. For my PhD project, I developed a novel method to isolate environmental phages that will hopefully be useful for ecological and clinical research in the future. I love exploring new samples, and I canâ€™t wait to see what we find this summer!
