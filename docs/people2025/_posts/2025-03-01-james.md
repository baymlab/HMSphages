As a former bench scientist and current lab manager, it's my goal to create and maintain an environment that makes your experience in the lab as safe, seamless, and productive as possible.  I find fulfillment in ensuring that we will have everything we could need to make the science happen, both at the bench and behind the scenes.  I am excited to see the great work that you'll be able to do during your time in this program.
