I am interested in understanding how phages interact with their host bacteria to gain control during infection, and how this knowledge can teach us about the special ways different bacteria grow and divide. I think through studying phages, we can ask big picture questions about bacterial and pathogen evolution as well as microbial community dynamics that can teach us more about the larger world around us. I am also passionate about sharing my love of research with others and canâ€™t wait to spread the joy of lab work to a new set of researchers.
