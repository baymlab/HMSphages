Many years ago, I was a struggling student at Pierce Community College in Los Angeles. One of my professors urged me to join a summer research program similar to Community Phages. At the time, I didn’t understand what I was signing up for or why my professor was so insistent that I try it out. But I had so much fun learning how to conduct experiments that summer, that I began taking my education seriously enough to pursue a science career. Nowadays, I’m a postdoctoral researcher trying to figure out how bacterial cells and their viral adversaries (phages) handle errors in protein production. Understanding how organisms deal with different types of protein errors may inform us about the evolution of cellular life and have important implications for human health and disease. This summer, I’m excited to join you, assist you, and learn alongside you in your hunt for new phages!
