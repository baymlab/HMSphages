I am fascinated by bacteria and all the intricate systems they use to survive as single cells. I am particularly interested in understanding how prophages, bacterial viruses that integrate in bacterial genomes, co-exist with each other and their bacterial hosts. During my PhD I studied prophages in Salmonella and the anti-phage defense systems they encode.  I am excited to learn more about new phages!
