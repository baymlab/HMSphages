I’m really interested in ways phages innovate new strategies to escape host defenses. I think it’s particularly exciting how bacteriophages have stark parallels with eukaryotic (human!) viruses—we can learn so much about human immune signaling pathways by studying these entities. I’m really excited to work together and uncover cool new biology!
