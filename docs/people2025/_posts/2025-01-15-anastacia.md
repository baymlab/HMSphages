Hi! I am a graduate of Manatee Community College in South Florida. I know first-hand what it is like to be interested in science, but overwhelmed of how to get started in understanding career options and routes to take for a career in science! I love sharing my experience of going from community college to working as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical school, and I am excited to work with you as you start your journey through college and getting to know science!
Scientifically I am interested in how bacteria digest the foods they eat, and how they use this fuel to grow.
