I am interested in understanding how phages impact microbial communities, specifically in the amazingly complex microbial community within our own gut. My research focuses on how molecules produced by bacteria to fight off phage infection are inadvertently recognized by the human immune system. Studying phages was one of my earliest exposures to research, and I canâ€™t wait to share that experience with other new researchers.
