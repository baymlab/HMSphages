Bacterial cells and the viruses that infect them are in constant conflict, and as a result, both have evolved many ways of manipulating each other. I am interested in the molecular basis of how viruses evade host immune defenses. Currently, I work on understanding the mechanisms by which bacterial cells sense phage infection and the evolutionary adaptations that have allowed phages to evade this detection system. For my graduate work I studied the immune response to vaccinia virus infection. Away from the lab I enjoy the outdoors through skiing, climbing, hiking, and biking.
