Phages have been at war with bacteria for billions of years and this conflict has led to incredible innovations in molecular biology. I am particularly excited about studying phage and bacteria to discover their molecular weapons and shields. My hope is that phage will teach us new principles of life and also yield new tools for synthetic biology. In my own research, I am passionate about visualizing large biological machines that cannot be seen by the naked eye using the techniques of electron microscopy. I am excited to share my experience and passion for bacteriophage and electron microscopy with students in this program.
