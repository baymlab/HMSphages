I am a graduate student focused on researching the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria. What I know about the world of phages I have gained through osmosis from interactions with Natalia and Siân, two passionate phage advocates in the Baym lab. I am originally from Puerto Rico, a small and beautiful island in the Caribbean. Now in Boston, the cold weather motivates me to stay in the lab, killing bacteria in the name of science. Outside of the lab, I like to listen to reggaeton and spend time with my very chaotic cat named Psi. I am excited to meet you all, learn a bit more about phages and support you through your scientific journey this summer!
