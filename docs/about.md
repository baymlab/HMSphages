# Diversity and Equity Mission

HMS Phages is committed to providing an engaging and immersive research experience. We recognize that there have been systemic injustices in the historical distribution of scientific research opportunities and support. Thus, we strive to facilitate an equitable and inclusive environment in which all students may feel supported and provided with opportunities to flourish.

# Acknowledgments

The HMS Phages program was inspired by the HHMI [SEA-PHAGES](https://seaphages.org/) program. Protocols and materials have been adapted or reproduced with permission. We are grateful to Viknesh Sivanathan from HHMI for assistance in the conception of this program.
