I came to phages from a longstanding interest in bacterial evolution, particularly in the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Iâ€™m interested in both phages that can be used to kill antibiotic resistant bacteria and the role they play in the spread of the genes that cause antibiotic resistance. I am excited for you to discover phages that affect the horizontal transfer of genes between bacteria, and to potentially use those phages and the biology we learn from them to better address antibiotic resistance.
