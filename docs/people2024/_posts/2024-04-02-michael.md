I’m a new convert to the world of phages. I came to them from a longstanding interest in bacterial evolution, particularly in the evolution of antibiotic resistance. In no small part thanks to Dr. Owen I’ve come to the idea that phages play a critical role in the evolution of antibiotic resistance, and in horizontal gene transfer more broadly. I am excited for you to discover phages that affect the horizontal transfer of genes between bacteria, and to potentially use those phages and the biology we learn from them to better address antibiotic resistance.
