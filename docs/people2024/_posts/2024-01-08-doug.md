I am interested in studying how cells defend themselves from viruses and the ways that viruses avoid these defenses. Some of our very own immune pathways and some of the most important biotechnologies can be traced back to the evolutionary battle between phages and bacteria. I am excited to work with you to identify new phages that can teach us about the innovative strategies bacteria and phages are using against one another.
