I am interested in how cells sense and defend against viral infection. My lab uses biochemistry to study how
human cells recognize viruses and how bacteria detect replication of phages. We have been surprised to learn
from our research that these processes are closely related, and human cells and bacteria use similar
mechanisms to resist virus replication. I am excited to work with you to identify new phages and discover how
bacteria and phages can teach us more about human immunity.
