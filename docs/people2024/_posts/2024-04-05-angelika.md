I am a visiting research Professor currently working in the Department of Microbiology herein Boston, but my own and  “home” lab is 5,265 km away at Imperial College in London. There we investigate how a small signalling nucleotide controls the survival, antibiotic resistance, and cell size of Staphylococcus aureus. Here in Boston,  I study how Bacillus subtilis builds its cell membrane. We use phages routinely in the lab, mostly to move DNA from one bacterium to another. But I have never isolated a new phage, so I am very excited to be able to join you in your journey to isolate and characterize your own phage!
