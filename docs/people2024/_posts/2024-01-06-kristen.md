I’m a postdoc in the Helaine lab, where I study the human pathogen Klebsiella. I like isolating new Klebsiella phages as a side project to my main research. During my PhD, I studied how phages influence the evolution of bacteria, and I am excited to share with you insights into how diverse phages shape bacterial communities. I am a native of Toronto, and have been known to pronounce “about” and “bag” in a way Americans find amusing.
