I am a graduate student in Sarah Fortuneâ€™s lab studying the genetic evolution of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*. Although I do not work with phages directly, I am interested in learning about microorganisms at the host-pathogen interface and believe we can learn a lot of cool biology through co-evolution of bacteria and phages. I also really enjoy the beauty of microbiology research and I am excited to share my enthusiasm with you all this summer!
