I study mobile genetic elements in bacteria, with a combination of bioinformatics and _wet lab_ methods. I'm particularly interested in the conflicts between conjugative plasmids and bacteriophages, and in isolating interesting phages that help us understand these conflicts.
Coding is an essential part of my research, but it is also one of my hobbies! Computers are incredibly powerful and flexible, and I love that you can do anything with them, from studying new phages, to  creating art.
