I have had a long interest in phages dating back to my graduate studies at Texas A&M University. There, I investigated the mechanisms by which phages lyse (blowup) their bacterial hosts to release progeny viruses so that they can go on to infect new hosts. Over the years, my lab has mainly focused on studies of bacterial cell biology and cell surface biogenesis. However, in recent years we have begun studying phages of corynebacteria and using them to help us understand how this class of bacteria grows. I am excited to work with you on the identification and characterization of new corynephages from the environment. There is great potential in this work to develop new tools for our studies and to discover new biological mechanisms.
