I believe that phages are the secret puppet masters of the bacterial world, shaping the lives of bacteria in inconceivably broad-ranging ways. My research focuses on how phages can rapidly alter bacterial biology and drive their evolution in interesting directions. I am passionate about communicating the joys of phage research, and make it my personal mission to "infect" as many people as possible.
