# Phage enrichment


## Objective
To amplify phages from environmental samples.

## Rationale
There are different ways to isolate phages from environmental samples. [Direct plating](./protocol_directplating.html) works well when the phages we're looking for are in enough abundance that we expect to find them in a small volume of our sample. If the phage is present at a lower concentration, using a larger volume of sample and doing an <mark>enrichment</mark>, increases our chances of finding it. _Enrichment_ is a technique in which we provide favorable conditions for a certain organism to grow. In this case, we provide phage in the sample an opportunity to replicate in a specific bacterial host. 

In this protocol, we filter a large volume of environmental sample to get rid of all the bacteria from the environment, keeping the phages. Then, we mix the filtrate with a culture of our host bacteria. Phages in the sample that can replicate in the provided host bacteria will lyse the cells they infect, and go through several rounds of infection, effectively "amplifying" the number of phages present in the culture. We then can filter this culture again, and test for the presence of an amplified phage by adding the filtrate on top of bacterial lawns.

This technique is useful, because even if there was only a single phage particle of interest in the sample, we would be able to capture it _after_ this amplification. Some things to consider: 1) The sample *for sure* contains *many* other phages for different bacteria, so even if we can’t see these phages because they can’t replicate in the bacterial host we’re using, we should be careful when handling the samples! 2) A sample might contain more than one type of phage that is able to infect our host, so we might be amplifying more than one phage during an enrichment. Therefore, it is very important to purify it later on! ([See: Protocol 6](./protocol_purification.html))

## Enrichment

### Before you start:
- You need a grown culture of your bacterial host.
- You need *2 days* to complete this section.
- Follow [Protocol 3: Acquiring and processing environmental samples](./protocol_sampling.html) to get your filtered sample.
- Retrieve your filtered sample(s) from the 4 ℃ fridge.

### Materials for enrichment
- x mL of appropriate 2X liquid media
- x mL of filtered environmental sample
- x mL culture tube
- 4 labeled microcentrifuge tubes per sample

### Procedure for enrichment

#### Day 1
<pre> </pre>

Team Coryne
{: .label .label-red }

1. Add x mL of the appropriate 2X [media](./protocol_hosts.html) to a culture tube.
2. Add x mL of filtered sample to a culture tube.
3. Inoculate the culture tube with x uL of bacterial host culture.
4. Incubate your enrichment at the [proper temperature](./protocol_hosts.html), shaking at 220 rpm, overnight.

Team plasmid-dependent
{: .label .label-purple }

1. Add x mL of the appropriate 2X [media](./protocol_hosts.html) to a culture tube.
2. Add x mL of filtered sample to a culture tube.
3. Inoculate the culture tube with x uL of each required bacterial host culture.
4. Incubate your enrichment at the [proper temperature](./protocol_hosts.html), shaking at 220 rpm, overnight.

#### Day 2
<pre> </pre>

Team Coryne
{: .label .label-red }

Team plasmid-dependent
{: .label .label-purple }

1. Fetch your enrichment from the incubator.
2. Transfer 1000 uL into a microcentrifuge tube. Transfer another 1000 uL into a second microcentrifuge tube.
3. Spin both of your tubes in the microcentrifuge, at maximum speed, for 1 minute. This will pellet the bacteria.
4. [Filter](./protocol_basictech.html#using-syringe-filters) the supernatant through a 0.22 µm filter, into new, clean, and *labeled* microcentrifuge tubes.
5. Appropriately dispose of the remaining enriched culture, and store your filtered enrichment in the 4 ℃ fridge.
