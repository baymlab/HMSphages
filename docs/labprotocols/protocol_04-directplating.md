# Direct plating of phages from environmental samples

## Objective
To isolate phages from an environmental sample

## Rationale
This is the fastest method to find phages in environmental samples. The filter sterilized sample is directly mixed with host bacteria and grown on an agar plate using the plaque assay. Any phages that are in the sample will infect and kill the immobilized bacteria in the agar, resulting in a hole in the bacterial lawn: a ‚Äúplaque‚Äù. This method gives you a quick snapshot of the phages present in your environmental sample that can infect your host bacteria, but any phages present in the sample at very low abundance may be missed using this approach.

### Before you start:
- You need your processed environmental samples (filter sterilized)
- You need a growing liquid culture of your bacterial host(s)
- You need to have pre-melted molten top agar in your [bead bath]
- Add salts to the top agar to facilitate phage adsorption. (10 mM CaCL2 or MgSO4)

### Materials for direct plating
- Processed environmental samples that have been filtered to remove all biomass
- X number of LB agar plates (as many plates as samples to be plated + 1 no sample control)
- X number of test tubes (as many tubes as samples + 1 for no sample control)
- LB top agar
- Serological pipettes

### Procedure
1. üñäÔ∏è Label LB agar plates with today's date, your name, your host bacteria and your sample ID, including a no phage control plate.
2. üß™ Set out as many test tubes as samples you will be plating. Label the tubes with the sample name, including a no sample control tube.
3. Add 250 uL of the appropriate bacterial host culture(s) to each labeled tube.
4. Add 250 uL of the sample, as well as 250 uL of SM buffer with no phage as a control. Gently vortex the tubes and allow to sit on the benchtop undisturbed for 10 minutes to allow phage adsorption
5. Using a sterile serological pipette, gently add 3 mL molten top agar supplemented with CaCl2 to a single tube, and immediately suck up the top agar/sample/bacteria mixture and transfer it to the appropriately labeled plates. Be sure to avoid air bubbles, as they can look like plaques on plates.
6. ‚ÜîÔ∏è Quickly tilt the plate in multiple directions until the top agar mixture evenly coats the agar plate. Once top agar has totally coated the surface, replace the lid and leave to set.
7. Repeat this process for all of your samples, including the no phage control.
Let the plates sit undisturbed for 20 minutes on the benchtop to allow the top agar to fully solidify.
8. üå°Ô∏è Incubate the plates overnight in the appropriate incubator.
