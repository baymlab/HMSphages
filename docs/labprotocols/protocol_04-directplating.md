# Direct plating of phages from environmental samples

## Objective
To isolate phages from an environmental sample

## Rationale
This is the fastest method to find phages in environmental samples. The filter sterilized sample is directly mixed with host bacteria and grown on an agar plate using the plaque assay. Any phages that are in the sample will infect and kill the immobilized bacteria in the agar, resulting in a hole in the bacterial lawn: a “plaque”. This method gives you a quick snapshot of the phages present in your environmental sample that can infect your host bacteria, but any phages present in the sample at very low abundance may be missed using this approach.

### Before you start:
- You need a growing liquid culture of your bacterial host(s).
- Retrieve your **filtered** sample(s) from the 4 ℃ fridge.
    + _They should have been processed as specified in:_ [_3.1 Sample processing_](./protocol_03-sampling.html#sample-processing)
- You need to have pre-melted molten top agar in your bead bath.
- Add salts to the top agar to facilitate phage adsorption. (10 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) *

### Materials for direct plating
- Processed environmental samples that have been filtered to remove all biomass.
- LB agar plates (as many plates as samples to be plated + 1 for _no-sample control_)
- Culture tubes (as many tubes as samples + 1 for _no-sample control_)
- LB top agar
- Serological pipettes

### Procedure
1. 🖊️ For each sample you are plating, label LB agar plates with today's date, your name, your host bacteria, and your **sample ID**. Label an additional LB agar plate as your _no-sample_ control plate.
1. 🧪 Set out as many culture tubes as samples you will be plating. Label one tube: _no-sample_ control, and label the rest of the tubes with the corresponding sample ID.
> You should have one plate and one tube **per** filtered sample, plus one tube and one plate for your _no-sample_ control.
1. ➕ Add the appropriate bacterial host culture(s) to each of the sample tubes.
- {: .label .label-red }Team Coryne:
- {: .fs-3 } **250** µL of _C. glu_
- {: .label .label-purple } Team plasmid-dependent: 
- {: .fs-3 } **100** µL of _E.coli_ - pRP4
- {: .fs-3 } **100** µL of _P. putida_ - pRP4
1. ➕ Add 250 µL of each filter-sterilized sample to the tubes.
1. 🌪 Gently vortex the tube.
1. ⏳ Let the tubes sit on the benchtop undisturbed for 10 minutes to allow phage adsorption.
1. ➕ Using a sterile serological pipette, gently add 3 mL molten top agar supplemented with CaCl<sub>2</sub> to a single tube, and immediately suck up the top agar/sample/bacteria mixture and transfer it to the appropriately labeled plates. _Be sure to avoid air bubbles, as they can look like plaques on plates._
1. ↔️↔️ Quickly tilt the plate in multiple directions until the top agar mixture evenly coats the agar plate. Once top agar has totally coated the surface, cover the plates with the lid and leave to set.
1. **Repeat this process for all of your samples, including the _no-sample_ control.**
1. ⏳ Let the plates sit undisturbed for 20 minutes on the benchtop to allow the top agar to fully solidify.
1. 🌡️ Incubate the plates overnight in the 30℃ incubator.
