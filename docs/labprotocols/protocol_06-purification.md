## Objective
{: .no_toc }
To isolate individual phages from the total plated population

## Rationale
{: .no_toc }

Now that you have isolated phages from your environmental sample, you are ready to start the purification process. It is possible that your environmental sample yielded more than one kind of phage. The goal of phage purification is to ensure that you end up with a phage sample that contains only one kind of phage. In other words, once purified, all the phage particles in your sample should be genetic clones of each other. This is called a “homogenous population” or a “clonal population” of phage. Having a pure phage population is very important because it will enable you to characterize your phage and discover its biological properties, including morphology, plaque size, and genome sequence. Imagine how difficult it would be to ascribe these properties to your phage if your sample contained many kinds of phages, each with its own morphologies and traits! Additionally, each plaque represents an individual phage that infected a single cell, and then continued to infect neighboring cells. Thus, each plaque contains hundreds to tens of thousands of viral particles! In order to purify individual phages from these picked plaques, we will need to serially dilute the samples and then perform a plaque assay to ensure a clonal population before we sequence the phages. Since we want to both have a pure stock, as well as the average number of phage particles per plaque, we will purify each plaque twice before amplifying the phage into a high titer lysate.

## Picking a plaque

### Before you start:
{: .no_toc }
- You need to have successfully had plaques form on your host

### Materials for picking a plaque
{: .no_toc }
- SM buffer
- One labeled microcentrifuge tube per sample
- P200 filter pipette tips

### Procedure for picking a plaque
{: .no_toc }
1. Label the plaques of interest with a marker on the bottom of the plate with identifiable letters or numbers to coordinate with what is recorded in your lab notebook. Opt for a plaque that is on a plate with 2-30 plaques with isolated phages to increase your chances of selecting a single phage.
2. Label the microcentrifuge tube(s) with the identifiers and today's date. Fill each tube with 500 uL SM buffer.
3. Using a sterile filter tip on the p200 pipette, gently stab the top agar the center of your plaque of interest while avoiding the bacteria around the plaque.
4. Place the end of the tip into the properly labeled tube with the SM buffer. Gently tap the tip on the tube wall and pipette up and down to dislodge phage particles. Discard the tip into the biohazard waste.
5. Firmly close the tube and mix by vortexing. Picked plaques can be stored at 4 C.
6. Proceed to serial dilution of phages for plaque assays.

## Serial dilution of phages for plaque assays

### Before you start:
{: .no_toc }
You need to have a phage stock of interest.

### Materials for serial dilution
{: .no_toc }
- SM buffer
- Microfuge tubes
- Filter pipette tips

### Procedure for serial dilution
{: .no_toc }
1. Arrange eight microfuge tubes in a rack labeled from 10-1 through 10-6. Fill each tube with 90 uL SM buffer.
2. Add 10 uL of your picked plaque to the 90 uL of SM buffer in the tube labeled 10-1. Discard the pipette tip, cap the lid tightly, and vortex to mix well. This is a tenfold dilution, also referred to a 1:10 dilution.
3. Transfer 10 uL of your 10-1 dilution into the 90 uL of SM buffer in the tube labeled 10-2. Discard the pipette tip, cap the lid tightly, and vortex to mix well. This is a hundredfold dilution, also referred to a 1:100 dilution.
4. Continue to transfer 10 uL in successive dilution until you get to your last tube. Be sure to make use of a new, sterile filter pipette tip for each transfer.
5. Continue on to the plaque assay for purification.

## Plaque assay for purification

### Before you start:
{: .no_toc }
- You need a growing culture of your bacterial host
- You need to have pre-melted molten top agar in your [bead bath]
- Add ions to the top agar to facilitate phage adsorption. (10 mM CaCL2 or MgSO4)

### Materials for plaque assays
{: .no_toc }
- X number of LB agar plates (as many plates as samples and dilutions to be plaqued + 1 no phage control)
- X number of test tubes (as many tubes as samples and dilutions to be plaqued + 1 for no phage control)
- LB top agar
- Serological pipettes
- Microcentrifuge tubes
- SM buffer

### Procedure for plaque assays
{: .no_toc }
#### Day 1
{: .no_toc }
1. Label LB agar plates with today's date, your name, your phage name, and dilutions to be plated, including a no phage control plate.
2. Set out as many test tubes as samples you will be plating. Label the culture tubes with the phage name and the phage dilution, including a no phage control tube.
3. Add 250 uL of the appropriate bacterial host to each labeled tube.
4. Add 10 uL of the appropriate phage dilution to each tube, as well as 10 uL of SM buffer with no phage as a control. 5. Gently vortex the tubes and allow to sit on the benchtop undisturbed for 10 minutes to allow phage adsorption
6. Using a sterile serological pipette, gently add 3 mL molten agar supplemented with CaCl2 to a single inoculated host, and immediately suck up the top agar/phage/bacteria mixture and transfer it to the appropriately labeled plates. 7. Be sure to avoid air bubbles, as they can look like plaques on plates.
8. Quickly tilt the plate in multiple directions until the top agar mixture evenly coats the agar plate. 
9. Repeat this process for all of your samples, including the no phage control.
10. Let the plates sit undisturbed for 20 minutes on the benchtop to allow the top agar to fully solidify.
11. Gently invert the plates and incubate overnight in the appropriate incubator.


#### Day 2
{: .no_toc }
1. Acquire plates from the incubator and observe plaques that formed overnight.
2. Scan images into scanner? Or take pictures with phone etc?? 
3. Count the number of plaques that have formed, taking into account which dilution gave a countable (30-300) number of plaques. See formula below to calculate the titer.
4. Record observations in your lab notebook. Things to keep in mind:
    + Does the number of plaques on each plate roughly follow a ten-fold dilution?
    + Do all of your plaques have the same morphology? If not, how do they differ?
    + Do you think that you have one unique phage in your plates, or do you think you have multiple phages? If you think you have multiple phages, what do you think you should do next?

We next will be repeating the plaque purification process to ensure that we have a clonal phage population. Using the protocols above:
1. Pick a plaque from your new plaque plates to further purify
2. Perform a Serial Dilution of your newly purified and picked phage
3. Now that you have an idea of the appropriate dilution to see single plaques from your picked phage, you may plate that concentration as well as one dilution higher and one dilution lower to “bracket” your sample and ensure you capture the appropriate dilution.
4. Perform a Plaque assay with your three “bracketed” phage dilutions onto the appropriate host
5. Incubate overnight

#### Day 3
{: .no_toc }
1. Acquire the plates from the incubator, and record observations, and calculate the titer of your phage stock.
2. Pick your plaque into 500 uL SM buffer. This is your final plaque purified phage stock.


#TO_DO
Calculate the titer in pfu/ml using the formula:
Titer (pfu/ml) = (# pfu/ volume used in μl) x (103 μl/ml) x dilution factor*
*For a 10-7 dilution, the dilution factor is 107. 
Example: If 24 plaques were observed on a plate from a culture infected with 10 μl of a 10-5 dilution (Figure 6.5-1), the calculations look like this: 
Titer (pfu/ml) = (24 pfu/10 μl) x (103 μl/ ml) x (105) 
          = (2.4 x 103 x 105) pfu/ml
          = 2.4 x 108 pfu/ml
Essentially, you are dividing the number of plaques by the volume of sample plated. That number is multiplied by the reciprocal of the dilutions used to make that plate and then converted from μl to ml to obtain the titer in pfu/ml.
